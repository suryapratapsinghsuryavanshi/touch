# touch
I'm a developer who regularly switches with multiple operating systems but in Windows, I seem to be missing a command. There are `touch` commands to create an empty file.

Use this NodeJs based CLI tool and use the touch command in your windows pc.

```sh
touch index.js # Created an empty file with name index.js
```

The primary task of the touch command is to modify the timestamp of a file or directory. But it is also used to create an empty file if the file already does not exist.
